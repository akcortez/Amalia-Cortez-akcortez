  <summary>BP-1 Discovering Open Source</summary>
1. What is open source?

Open source is open collaboration with software on a variety of projects that solve a variety of problems that people can apply their knowledge in whatever project they are interested in. It is a concept that continues to grow as time moves on and remains popular through developers. It has many aspects and individuals who contribute to or manage the program.

2. What surprised me?

It surprised me how many people actually go into and contribute to open source projects just for fun. It was also extremely surprising how many companies released open source code to the public and how much of that can be accessed so easily, especially since I was under the notion that this data was private. The team and contribution that goes toward an open source project was extremely interesting too since everyone has a role to play and to keep up with that role, no matter how big or small, remains a big responsibility.

3. Which well-known companies and projects use open source, and why does that matter?

Some examples of well-known companies that use open source is Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Linux, but there are way more examples! These companies use open source to meet to the needs of the program without worrying about revenue right away. It helps get collaboration on projects without much baggage. It makes it extremely easy to get work done and review work since it is a public domain, allowing anyone to work on it when they please!

  <summary>BP02 - GitHub and Markdown</summary>
1. What I learned about Markdown and Git?

I learned that git and GitHub are two different things. Git is a version control system, meanwhile GitHub allows a platform for hosting repositories ([GitHub VS Git](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/git/difference-between-git-and-github/)). Exploring the process of writing code and commits to share with others on a similar project is extremely useful. It allows me to explore how I can make a contribution to projects and track the changes I made easily. I now understand how markdown is extremely common among writing files and documentation for other programmers. It is easy to read and allows an easy implementation of the addition of code snippets to communicate among other people. 

2. How they help me contribute to open source and improve professionally?

Markdown and Git allows me to contribute to open source because understanding Git gives me the ability to make changes safely. I can make copies of a project and make my own changes a lot easier than working on it directly. It also allows others to approve my changes and get feedback with extreme ease. Markdown allows me to communicate documentation and help others understand my code with ease rather than leaving it to be guessed. It helps communicate what I need to so that other programmers can understand what I am trying to do. 

3. Have you use them before? What surprised you about Markdown or Git?

I had used Markdown once and Git a lot during the summer. During my internship I had to make a wiki to handoff information about my project to my team and it made it a lot easier to upload files and express my changes to my team. I got to link absolutely everything I worked on and give them all the supplies/details of my project so that they could continue after me. I used Git as well, so I understood some of the commands and worked on a different branch so that my changes could be tracked within their existing packages. I honestly had a lot of trouble understanding the process of Git since it was extremely easy to run the wrong command and mess up the entire commit, but using it helped me realize what was needed in order to work on the same project with an entire team!

  <summary>BP-3 Explore Open Source Projects</summary>
1. How I chose a repository to explore and what I found interesting about its structure, community, and contribution process.

   I chose a repository by looking up things I enjoy and seeing if there is open source projects availiable regarding my interests. I also made sure to see if it was in langauges I knew how to write. I found game development and knew I was interested in it. I thought it was interesting how many projects were out there and what companies offer open source projects. I did not realize how much information was in repos and what details they offered. I thought it was extremely helpful the kind of information was provided regarding the project and it makes it a lot easier to insert yourself as a collaborater to the project. I also saw how much talking and communication goes on in repos. I did not realize how easy it was to get help and to reach out to people! I think the contribution process and the steps that goes into it help give a clean setup to adding to the project. It gives a sense of structure to the contributions to keep track of changes made easier.

  <summary>BP04 Explore Open Source Revealjs</summary>
After exploring Reveal.js, describe how it’s structured, what it’s for, and what you found interesting about the way the project is documented and maintained. Could you imagine yourself contributing to this? Why or why not?

### Structure
Reveal.js has an entire [repo](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) dedicated to the project itself. It allows for open source contribution by forking the repo and allowing the contributor to make their own edits to the live slideshow. Through the demo file, the contributor can make changes and see the changes in the live preview. It has a live [demo](https://revealjs.com/#/) that shows the different aspects of the project. Hakim El Hattab is the author of the reveal.js repo and manages the changes created in the repo. The README is extremely clear and contains many links toward other sites with even more information. It has details on installing reveal.js, viewing the demo presentation, documentation, visual editor, and even a video course. It allows a great beginning guide for new contributors. 

### What it is for

Reveal.js is an HTML open source framework that supports slideshow editing and viewing. The slideshow contains a lot of different aspects such as colors, changing text, transitions, and so on. Since it is open source that means collborators are allowed to go in and expierience the repo first hand on their local machine. It is for people looking to put their own take on their own slideshow to edit and bring across their message. Now anyone can use the template to create their own slideshow with anything they want to display by editing the HTML.

### Interesting (documentation/maintained)
The [README](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/README.md) is extremely detailed and gives many resources in order for people to get started. They have [workflow](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tree/master/.github/workflows) documents showing the flow of changes and how things are added. They even have an entire folder for [example](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tree/master/examples) presentations in case anyone wanted to explore the different ways the slideshow could be manipulated. There are many issues open for this repo and have many things that may need to be addressed, but it seems that other collaborators respond with as much feedback in order to help resolve what is wrong.

## Contributing 
I could imagine myself contributing to this. It is a nice way to practice HTML and Github through something as simple as code instead of just using a slideshow app. I think it brings a lot more skill and resources that are more helpful to me rather than just using Google to make the slideshow. It also is an open source project so contributing can be extremely easy since I understand how to fork the repo and use the code on my own!

  <summary>Blog Prompt: “Ownership, Access, and Innovation: What I Learned About Licensing.”</summary>
#### Reflect on something you learned about open source licenses (e.g., MIT vs GPL, what’s allowed, what’s restricted).
From the presentation I learned that licensing can last up to 90 years after someone passes away because of Mickey Mouse! I thought that was funny because I honestly had no idea. I also learned how important it is to have a license. I thought because it was open source that licensing was not a big thing, but it allows contributors to play their part and add what they want while keeping integrity with these kinds of projects. The open licenses allow people to contribute without worrying about what is hidden or what might not be allowed. It keeps it so they won't get in trouble for putting their input on a project. It creates a framework for what is allowed to be distributed and accessed with the conditions presented. 
#### How did the Tetris movie shape your understanding of software ownership and distribution?
I did not realize how complex and twisted things can get with licensing. Tetris did not seem like an insane thing to me until I wanted the movie. It displays a complicated structure in how easy it is to lose licensing and how hard it is to even get it. Seeing the different groups of people fight so hard to get through to this game showed me the dynamic in which people will go long and far just for credit. It made me realize how important it is and how licensing is something to think about right away rather than later and helps me think about future projects I may contribute to and how to be careful around things such as that. 
#### What surprised or intrigued you about NIU’s approach to IP, patents, and tech transfer?
I was intrigued by the connection to the Office of Innovation! I realize now that students who contribute may need to think about what they want to do and how they want to approach their projects. Considering everyone who was in the project, such as just using NIU's lab, allows another entity to think about when it comes to licensing. It was interesting to see where the lines begin to blur in contribution. I do enjoy the protection they offer and the fact that our university offers this type of help can be extremely benefitial to the innovations students create!
#### How do you think licensing empowers or complicates open innovation?
I think it complicates open innovation. It creates a hard decision of who gets credit for what. Everyone contributes in their own ways and open source supports that, but when things get serious and released, people get faced with the idea that their work might not be in their credit, rather someone elses it. It can be discouraging to understand that your contribution might be swept under the rug in terms of licensing. 

Bonus: Can you find and interpret the license used in a project you’re interested in contributing to?
The [repo](https://github.com/codedecks-in/LeetCode-Solutions?tab=MIT-1-ov-file#readme) I explored earlier, Codedecks, has an MIT license. I didn't understand why this open source project needed a license because all they do is post answers, but now I see the protection it offers. It allows students like me to continue to use this software and develop with projects I may enjoy.

### What you learned from participating in MLH Global Hack Week

I learned so much about Major League Hacking and what they do as an organization. Although I was familiar with them before GHW, I learned more about what GHW was and what kinds of events were hosted during it. I got to explore many different topics and see what was offered through MLH. I attended a livestream and learned about open source in even greater depth. Personally, I am contributing to an open source project in Huskie Hackers, so seeing the kinds of things to look out for in open repos and diving into deeper concepts rather than just a quick overview was extremely helpful.

### What contribution (or challenge) you made

The challenge I participated in was registering for MLH's AI/ML informational sessions! I personally wanted to explore more of what MLH offered and am extremely interested in learning about artificial intelligence and machine learning since it is a field that continues to grow over time. Although it was a simple challenge, I thought it was an important one because it continued my engagement with Major League Hacking and allowed me to branch out and find more interesting information that they offer. I am excited to continue my journey with the resources presented to me through MLH. GHW introduced me to even more events they had to offer and allowed me to broaden my horizons.

### Who you connected with or learned from

I watched a livestream from Alberto from MLH. He is a Developer Relations Coach at Major League Hacking. He teaches and leads many informational sessions to educate students about topics related to Major League Hacking. On his [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/albertocamarena-dev_im-on-the-cover-activity-7095111280516063233-JsTN), he has past experience in development and continues his career currently at MLH.

### How this experience shaped your view of open source collaboration

This experience shaped my view of open source collaboration and created a deeper understanding of what I can do to contribute to it. I was always taught about contributing, but Alberto showed me more about owning an open source repo and the importance of each piece of the puzzle for people who might want to contribute to mine. I think it shaped my view personally because I will be working on open repos soon and figuring out how to make a repo open source. I learned a lot about open source and the different tools you can use and learn. I used to feel confined to stick to what I already know, but learning more can be an extremely valuable tool for open source projects.

  <summary>BP07 Explore Non Code Contribution</summary>
## Blog Prompt:

### What counts as a contribution in open source?
Absolutely anything counts as a contribution. As long as you are making an effort or putting some sort of change toward the repo, then it will be counted as a contribution. I don't think there is a too big or too small contribution. Every single change a person can make is so important and contains so much value to a project. 

### My thoughts on the value of code and non-code contributions. 
I think both are extremely valuable. You need both to make a good repo, especially since some people are better at non-code things and some are better at code things. Having both contains importance in building a repo as things like documentation and writing are just as important as the code itself. If no one tests or explains how things work, then contributing becomes harder and harder. 

### How diagrams help clarify a workflows. 
Diagrams help clarify workflows because it creates a visual on what is being done and worked on. Visuals allow an easier way to comprehend what is being done compared to something concrete. It brings everything together and shows the relationship things may have with each other and how they influence each other. 

### How communication and collaboration shape successful non code contributions. 
You need to communicate to others and work together to discuss your thoughts and concerns you may have with one another. Being able to communicate what you need towards the contribution allows for ease in understanding what you can put in. Another thing is with collaborating, you need to understand how to work together to make the contribution work as a whole. Doing it piece by piece seperately or doing a different thing entirely will not make a good contribution. 

### What non code contribution opportunities did you find?
I found a lot on testing and documentation. Testing is really important because those who contribute that way may see things that the code contributors do not see. When you work on material for so long, finding things may be harder compared to someone who is looking at it the first time. Documentation is important as well. It helps pass along the work already done to someone new who may want to continue. </details>
