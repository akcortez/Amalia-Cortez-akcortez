# Huskie Hackers
Description: Huskie Hackers is a club I run at Northern Illinois University where students come together and participate in competitive hackathons to imrpove our programming skills outside of school.

## Midnight Hackathon
Huskie Hackers took the chance to participate in the [Midnight Hackathon](https://events.mlh.io/events/12829){: target="_blank"}! For Midnight Hackathon, participants used the company Midnight's software to create a project based on personal data protection. The team came up with a project called the [Secret Scheduler Pro](https://devpost.com/software/secret-scheduler-pro){: target="_blank"} in which building admin have the ability to host rooms and workers could check in from different companies without having to share their personal work data. The building admin would get the information they need, which is just the information needed to check in, while keeping workers data safe. Huskie Hackers spent hours on end developing an idea and learning the new tool handed to them. The hackathon lasted an entire weekend, was the first hackathon of all the participants, and was a great experience!
   
## Open Source Hackathon
Huskie Hackers participated in Major League Hacking’s [Open Source Hackfest](https://events.mlh.io/events/11515?_gl=1*1qe6613*_ga*MzMxNTE2Mzk3LjE3NjAzODg4NTg.*_ga_E5KT6TC4TK*czE3NjMxNDE3MzkkbzExJGcxJHQxNzYzMTQxNzYyJGozNyRsMCRoMA..)! The team built upon existing projects from the 71 North Partnership Studio to create a new and unique game. The original project, Air Draw, was developed by 71 North student Nikhil Kethineni. It allowed users to draw on the screen with their fingers using a variety of colors. Huskie Hackers took this foundation, and drawing inspiration from Google’s 2016 Halloween Doodle, transformed it into an interactive, ghost-battling experience. Instead of using a cat to cast spells on screen, players now sketch shapes themselves to defeat ghosts in real time. The process required learning how the existing code worked, identifying where to make enhancements, and finding creative ways to preserve the original concepts while adding a fun and fresh twist. You can even check out the live [demonstration](https://devpost.com/software/air-ghosts)!
   
## Jame gam
Huskie Hackers participated in their very first [Mini Jame Gam](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jame-gam-49)! A game jam is an event where a team comes together to develop a game within a limited period of time, usually centered around a specific theme. This year’s Mini Jame Gam featured the theme "Explosion" with a special required item: "Box".

Huskie Hackers had less than three days to create a game from scratch that incorporated both elements. Their final creation combined prehistoric and futuristic ideas with a fun twist. To incorporate the "box", the team designed a fighting game where the weapon is a microwave and the microwave explodes!

In the game, you play as a caveman battling a bear using a microwave that you must load with the scurrying rats around you. As you fight the bear, the level becomes increasingly challenging and introduces many exciting attacks.

You can play the game here: [Rat Go Boom!]((https://akcortez.itch.io/rat-go-boom))
